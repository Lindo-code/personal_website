            Hello, and welcome to the website! My name is Lindo Matabane; an aspiring web-dev slash all-round programmer, I began to seriously pursue programming at around the beginning of 2021, when I made the conscious decision to get into programming I searched for opportunities online and discovered the Umuzi program, of which I subsequently applied to and recieved a reply accepting me into their bootcamp. After a rigorous three weeks of navigating through git, recieving strict project reviews and pushing for on-time submissions I made it into the Umuzi program.
            <br>
            <br>
            As someone who is highly focused and attentive to detail, I am fairly positive that I will thrive in the coding environment with the help of Umuzi and fellow students. I am also aware of the need for continued self improvement, that's why I take full advantage of palatforms like Hackerrank and Codewars that challenge my problem solving abilities and help me familiarise myself with not only the jargon, but also the different methods available for me to utilize when coding. Through these platforms I was able to realize just how challenging coding can be and that similar to mathematics I have to apply myself on a daily basis in order to become a competent programmer.

            WHY CODE?
            <hr class="hr_solid2" />
          </h4>
          <p>
            I found many aspects of the programming space that interested me, but what enticed me more was the creative aspect to it, and for some time I never saw the type of creative exploration that I wanted to be involved in within the coding space so I perceived the field as very rigid and unyielding. Since I've always viewed myself as more artistic than logical it took some time and a little more knowledge for me to discard that narrow viewpoint towards programming and begin to see myself being a part of that environment. Once that happened I started to really discover the possibilities of coding and I feel I'm just brushing the surface.
